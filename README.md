# dendron
dendron is an experimnet in making a single code-base/multi-site installation of Moodle. 

The goal is to configure an apache v-host and Moodle config.php in such a way as to allow a single codebase serve multiple Moodele sites. This will facilitate version management, reliability, desaster recovery, and porability in environments where multiple Moodle sites share a production environment. 

The nam dendrom derives from greek for tree: The branches of the tree are the individual sites; the single codebase the trunk; and the site-specific databases and moodledata directories are the roots.
